        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>Autogram does not share personal information. That is our privacy policy in a nutshell. The rest of this page explains why you should care.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    INFORMATION WE COLLECT
    <br>

	•	Account Information: Your username, password, and email address when you register for an Autogram account.
	•	Profile Information: Information you provide for your user profile (e.g., first and last name, picture, phone number). This information allows us to help you or others be “found” on Autogram.
	•	User Content: Content (e.g., photos, comments, and other materials) that you post to the Service.
	•	Communications: Communications between you and Autogram. For example, we may send you service-related emails (e.g., account verification, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). Note that you may not opt-out of service-related emails.
<br>
<br>
ANALYTICS INFORMATION
<br>

We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information in aggregate form so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular individual user.

Cookies and Similar Technologies

To protect your privacy, we do not use any cookies intentionally. However, the Service may contain cookies that are necessary for the proper working of Autogram.

Log File Information

To protect your privacy, we do not use any logs intentionally.
<br>
<br>
HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION
<br>

We use the information we collect to:
	•	Help you efficiently access your information after you sign in.
	•	Remember information so you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Service.
	•	Provide, improve, test, and monitor the effectiveness of our Service.
	•	Develop and test new products and features.
	•	Monitor metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns.
	•	Diagnose or fix technology problems.
	•	Automatically update the Autogram application on your device.

Autogram or other users may run contests, special offers, or other events or activities (“Events”) on the Service. If you do not want to participate in an Event, do not use the particular metadata (i.e., hashtag or geotag) associated with that Event.
<br>
<br>
SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION
<br>

Autogram values your privacy most, so we will not rent or sell your information to third parties outside Autogram without your consent.
	•	Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as User Content, becomes available to the public. Once you have shared User Content or made it public, that User Content may be re-shared by others.
	•	If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service.

We may access, preserve, and share your information in response to a legal request (such as a search warrant, court order, or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of India where we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards. We may also access, preserve, and share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent, and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you, and others, including as part of investigations; and to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. Information we receive about you may be accessed, processed, and retained for an extended period when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations concerning possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm.
<br>
<br>
CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY
<br>

Autogram may modify or update this Privacy Policy from time to time, so please review it periodically. We may provide you additional forms of notice of modifications or updates as appropriate under the circumstances. Your continued use of Autogram or the Service after any modification to this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such modification.
